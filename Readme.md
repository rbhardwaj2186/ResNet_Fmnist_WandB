In this tutorial we will be implementing the ResNet model. We'll show how to load your own dataset, using the CIFAR10 dataset as an example, and also how to use learning rate schedulers which dynamically alter the learning rate of your model whilst training. Specifially, we'll use the one cycle policy introduced in this paper and is now starting to be commonly used for training computer vision models.
